NexTalk – Real-Time Chat Application 

“Because talking to yourself in the console doesn’t count as chatting anymore.” 😅

🧠 Overview

NexTalk is a full-stack real-time chat application built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React (Vite).
It delivers seamless live messaging, secure authentication, and a responsive, modern UI.

Developed over 4 intense weeks of coding, debugging, and “why is this not working?!” moments — but the result was absolutely worth it!
